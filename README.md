# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction  
**Machine Learning Notebook**

This project is a Jupyter Notebook that builds a **machine learning model** to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on medical features. The notebook includes all steps—data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

---

## 📌 Overview  
The notebook walks through the full ML pipeline:

### ✔️ Data Preprocessing  
- Handling missing values  
- Encoding categorical features  
- Normalizing numerical attributes  
- Splitting dataset into train/test

### ✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Correlation heatmaps  
- Feature importance  
- Distribution plots  
- Relationship between medical risk factors and disease outcome

### ✔️ Machine Learning Models  
Several classification models are trained and compared, such as:  
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Support Vector Machine  
- Gradient Boosting  

Each model is evaluated using:  
- Accuracy  
- Precision, Recall  
- F1-Score  
- ROC-AUC curve

## 📊 Dataset  
The project uses a heart disease dataset (such as the UCI Cleveland dataset), containing common medical attributes like:  
- Age  
- Sex  
- Chest pain type  
- Resting blood pressure  
- Cholesterol  
- Fasting blood sugar  
- Maximum heart rate achieved  
- Exercise-induced angina  
- ST depression  
- And more  

---

## 🚀 How to Use  
Simply **open the `.ipynb` file** in:  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- JupyterLab  
- VS Code (with Python/Jupyter extensions)  

Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and model results.

---

## 📈 Results  
- Achieved strong prediction accuracy (~85–92% depending on the model).  
- Identified the strongest predictors of heart disease:  
  - Chest pain type  
  - Maximum heart rate  
  - Age  
  - ST depression  
  - Cholesterol levels
